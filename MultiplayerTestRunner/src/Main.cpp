/********************************
 * MULTIPLAYER TEST RUNNER
 * This is a CLI application designed to launch specified tests on independent processes (as CSP currently supports only one user per process), in
 * order to support testing multiple clients on multiple processes interacting in the same space.
 * When used in an automated testing context, it is
 * designed to communicate back with the calling process via stdout process descriptors (see `include/ProcessDescriptors.h`), such that the calling
 * process can reliably call assertions with the correct timings.
 * The CLI itself provides some flexibility for use in a more direct manner as an ad-hoc test application.
 *
 * Dependencies :
 *	- CSP. From the ConnectedSpacePlatform Solution. Linked.
 *  - UUID_v4. For generating unique space names. Header only.
 *  - CLI11. For defining the command line interface. Header only.
 ********************************/

/*
 * Calls the appropriate test based on the provided test identifier stored in settings
 * Will print the READY_FOR_ASSERTIONS_DESCRIPTOR when after the test code has been executed
 * By this point, the client should be logged in and inside a space, hence tests need not concern themselves with space creation and cleanup.
 * This function blocks until the timeout has elapsed.

	 * Perform the timeout wait
	 * The idea of the tests above is that they setup a state in a space and then exit, so calling processes can validate that state
	 * This serves to make the test application wait until the timeout occurs, so the space is not cleaned up before the check can happen.
	 * The process won't always exit this way, sometimes it will be terminated.
	 * If terminating, the caller is responsible for any space cleanup, and outside of throwaway executions,
	 * should have been using the `spaceID` option to provide a managed space.
	 *
	 * If you do need a test that performs continual actions (such as constant position updates), feel free to put a busy loop
	 * in your test to do this, just be aware that if you don't have an exit condition, the test will continue forever unless terminated. (Which isn't
	 * the worst thing)
