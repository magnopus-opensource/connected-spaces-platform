# Overview

Interoperability is the foundation of the spatial internet. We need experiences to move across multiple technologies in harmony, bridging applications and devices so that we can move beyond a series of disconnected islands.

The Connected Spaces Platform is a library that provides developers across a range of language and platforms with a means to build *interoperable, cross-reality, multi-user applications*.

It comes in the form of an open-source client-side library, effectively encoding in binary form the standards by which applications can interoperably communicate with one another. Standards that we can all contribute to.
