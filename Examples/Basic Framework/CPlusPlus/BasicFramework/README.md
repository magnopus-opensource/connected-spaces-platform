# CSP C++ Basic Framework example

## Overview
This example is a console application, which guides the user through a number of steps that illustrate the basic usage of CSP in native C++.

These steps cover:
- Starting and stopping CSP
- Creating and destroying a multiplayer connection 
- Creating an account and authenticating
- Managing Spaces
- Creating and manipulating an Avatar
- Managing assets

## Setup and Running
Open the solution and build and run as either Debug or Release. This application requires Windows SDK 10.0 or later. Follow the on-screen prompts to run through the steps as outlined above.

The first time you run through the example you will likely not have a valid account for the **CSP_HELLO_WORLD** example tenant. The console application will ask you whether you already have an account to which you should enter **N** for no. It will then ask you to enter a valid email address and password. At this point you will be directed to close the console application and to respond to a **Welcome to OKO!** email. Once you have clicked the **Verify email now** link contained you will be able to restart the console application, this time entering **Y** for yes when asked if you already have an account. You will then be able to proceed with the console application example.
