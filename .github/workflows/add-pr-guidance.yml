            # 🚀 Pull Request Review Guidelines

            Thank you for taking the time to review this Pull Request. The following is a summary of our Pull Request guidelines. The full guidelines can be found [here](https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/blob/main/PR_GUIDELINES.md).

            ## 💬 How to Provide Feedback
            We use a **comment ladder** when leaving review comments to avoid any ambiguity.

            | Tag | Is response required? | Is a change required? | May the PR author resolve? |
            |:----|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|:--------------------------:|
            | [Fix] | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌ |
            | [Consider] | ✔️ | ❌ | ✔️ |
            | [Question] | ✔️ | ❌ | ❌ |
            | [Nit] | ❌ | ❌ | ✔️ |
            | [Comment] | ❌ | ❌ | ✔️ |

            All comments should be prefixed with one of the above tags, for example:
            `[fix] Your editor is still set to use tabs instead of spaces, or this file is old and needs to be reformatted.`

            ⚠️ Reviewers should be sure to resolve conversations if they feel their feedback has been addressed sufficiently.

            ## 🎯 PR Author Focus Areas
            * **Link Commits to Conversations** After making a change in response to a reviewer's comment, link the specific commit in the comment thread. This will allow the reviewer to view the change without having to hunt the codebase for it.
            * **Breaking Changes** Any breaking changes made to the public interface must be specifically called out in the PR. The preferred format is a bullet list enumerating the specific nature of the change/s, as well as the types and method signatures that are affected. If necessary, migration guidance should also be provided here.


            Thanks again for taking the time to review this Pull Request.
          # An optional string to identify the comment. If a comment with this ID already exists,
          # it will be updated instead of a new one being created.
          # This prevents multiple guidance comments on the same PR.
