Welcome to the Connected Spaces Platform! We are thrilled to have you contribute to our open-source project. This document outlines the guidelines and best practices to ensure a smooth and collaborative experience for all contributors.

# Code of Conduct

The Connected Space Platform follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/). Please read and adhere to our [code of conduct](https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/blob/main/CONDUCT.md) to foster an inclusive and respectful community.

# Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have a basic understanding of C++ and familiarity with realtime-engine concepts and constraints. If you are new to the library, we recommend exploring our documentation and examples to gain a better understanding of its capabilities.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies as outlined in the [documentation](https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/wiki/Building-CSP-for-CPP).
3. Build and run the project locally to ensure it is functioning correctly, you can find build instructions for our different platforms [here](https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform#-build-instructions).

# Contributing

We appreciate and encourage contributions from the community. Whether you find a bug, have a feature request, or want to submit a code improvement, your contributions are valuable. Here are a few ways you can contribute:

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any bugs, issues, or have a general question about the library, please submit an issue on the GitHub repository. When reporting an issue, provide as much relevant information as possible, including the steps to reproduce the problem, any error messages, and the expected behavior.

## Feature Requests

If you have an idea for a new feature or improvement, please create a new issue on GitHub and label it as a feature request. Describe the feature in detail, explaining its purpose and potential benefits to the library. This will allow the community to discuss and provide feedback on the proposed feature.

## Submitting Pull Requests

To contribute code changes or bug fixes, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`
3. Make your desired changes and ensure the code follows the [programming guidelines](https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/wiki/Programming-guidelines).
4. Write unit tests, if applicable, to validate the changes.
5. Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.
6. Push the changes to your forked repository.
7. Open a pull request against the repository's develop branch.
8. Provide a clear description of the changes, filling out any of the boilerplate information requested, include any related issues or feature requests.

Our team will review your pull request, provide feedback, and work with you to address any necessary changes. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the repository.

# Style Guide

Maintaining consistent code style helps improve readability and maintainability. Please follow the existing code style in the library and adhere to the following [programming guidelines](https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/wiki/Programming-guidelines).

# Documentation

Good documentation is crucial for the success of an open-source project. When contributing to the Connected Spaces Platform, please ensure that your changes include relevant updates to the documentation. This includes code comments and any other documentation files.

* Update code comments: Document your code changes using inline comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the code. Clear and concise comments help other developers understand your implementation. Ensure these comments follow our [programming guidelines](https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/wiki/Programming-guidelines).

* Update documentation files: If your changes require updates to any other documentation files, such as tutorials, guides, or API references, make sure to include these updates as well, or if you do not have access to update these, you can request a change using a ticket, citing your Pull Request as a reference. Keep the documentation up to date with the latest changes in the library, if they are not already.

* Improve existing documentation: If you notice any areas of the documentation that are unclear or incomplete, feel free to improve them. Add missing explanations, correct errors, or provide additional examples to enhance the overall quality of the documentation. Please provide these changes in separate Pull Requests if they relate to systems other than those you are updating/fixing/adding.

# Testing

Maintaining a robust testing suite ensures the stability and reliability of the Connected Spaces Platform. When making contributions, please consider the following:

* Write tests: If your changes involve new features or modify existing functionality, write appropriate tests to validate the correctness of your code. Ensure that the tests cover various scenarios and edge cases.

* Test coverage: Aim for high test coverage to minimize the risk of introducing regressions. Strive to test critical functionality and any complex or error-prone parts of the code.

* Test execution: Run the existing test suite locally to ensure that your changes do not break any existing functionality. Include the necessary steps for running the tests in the contribution documentation.
