# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

🍰 🙌 New Features

- [NT-0] feat: Add `SetUserTier` method to `QuotaSystem` by MAG-ElliotMorris
  This method provides a means of changing a users tier (basic, pro, enterprise, etc)
  through the api. This method will only succeed when logged in as an admin user.
  This method is mostly for internal testing, but there is no harm allowing public use.

- ### 🐛 🔨 Bug Fixes

- [OB-4350] fix: Improved log output for unmodifiable entities by MAG-mav
This improves the clarity of logs that are output when an unmodifiable entity is attempted to be modified.
Also adds IRealtimeEngine::IsEntityModifiable and derived functions in all realtime engine implementations.
Also adds SpaceEntity::IsModifiableWithReason which cts as a wrapper around the above functions.

## [6.20.0] - 2026-01-13_17-38-31

### 🔥 ❗ Breaking Changes

- [OB-4154] fix!: Improve how Hotspot sequence event data is handled by MAG-AdamThorn
  The existing implementation of `HotspotSequenceChangedNetworkEventData` was unnecessarily complex and confusing to developers. This event type has now been removed and new `SpaceId` and `SequenceType` properties have been added to the `SequenceChangedNetworkEventData`.
  This is a breaking change:
  * `SequenceChangedNetworkEventData` no longer has a `HotspotData` member.
  * `SequenceChangedNetworkEventData` has two new members, `SpaceId` (String) and `SequenceType` (ESequenceType enum).
  * When renaming a Hotspot Sequence, access to the old and new names has been updated as follows:
      * SequenceChangedNetworkEventData.HotspotData.Name > SequenceChangedNetworkEventData.Key
	  * SequenceChangedNetworkEventData.HotspotData.NewName > SequenceChangedNetworkEventData.NewKey

## [6.19.0] - 2026-01-07_12-46-10

🍰 🙌 New Features

- [NT-0] feat: Exposed equality and inequality operators for `Vector2`, `Vector3`, `Vector4` and `Map` by MAG-ElliotMorris.
  Also added hash functions in the `std` namespace for the Vector types.
  
### 🐛 🔨 Bug Fixes

- [OB-4123] fix: Fix some text rendering as black/unreadable in generated docs.

## [6.17.0] - 2025-12-15_14-00-12

### 🐛 🔨 Bug Fixes

- [NT-0] fix: Address rare race condition in legacy leadership election by MAG-ElliotMorris
  It was possible to trigger a memory race using `EnableLeaderElection` or `DisableLeaderElection` after having returned from `EnterSpace` in the OnlineRealtimeEngine.
  This is due to the leader election being performed in the all entities retreived function, which can come back asyncronously to enable asset streaming, giving a chance for threading syncronisation error.
  Solved with a mutex for now, although the best solve is to move leader election elsewhere.

- [OW-2312] fix: Add select_account for authorise URL prompt parameter.
  Google made changes to the way the oauth URL works, so we need to set prompt to select_account rather than none to restore the functionality. This change updates that parameter in the GetThirdPartyProviderAuthoriseURL function.
- [OPE-2982] fix: Unity Android debug builds crash on login. Caused by Android not being able to find the CSP library file.

## [6.16.0] - 2025-12-09_19-48-30



## [6.15.0] - 2025-12-08_20-00-56

🔥 ❗Breaking Changes

- [OB-4579] fix!: Issues around renaming hotspot groups by MAG-ChristopherAtkinson
  Rename event has been deprecated and removed at the services level. This is a breaking change due to the removal of the csp::common::ESequenceUpdateType::Rename.

🍰 🙌 New Features

- [OF-1758] feat: replace assertion in token expiration with meaningful log to notify users by MAG-ChristopherAtkinson
  RefreshIfExpired invokes a fatal log message in place of the existing assert as asserting on a refresh token failure is too aggressive.
  
🙈 🙉 🙊 Test Changes

- [NT-0] test: Await exiting spaces in certain realtime engine tests by MAG-ElliotMorris.
  Correct usage of the realtime engine requires that the exit space call returns fully before deleting the memory, these tests did not do that.

## [6.14.0] - 2025-12-02_17-43-07

🔥 ❗Breaking Changes

- [OF-1806] refac!: Add a new URL property and deprecate others in the AvatarSpaceComponent in https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/pull/872
  Simplify the setting and getting of the mesh URL for the avatar component. This is a breaking change due to the removal of the getters and setters for CustomAvatarUrl and AvatarMeshIndex.

## [6.13.0] - 2025-11-28_20-11-35

🔥 ❗Breaking Changes

- [NT-0] feat!: expose refresh token expiry length by MAG-ChristopherAtkinson in https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/pull/863
  Expose RefreshTokenExpiryLength to the token options to support clients configuring custom durations.

### 🔨 🔨 Chore

- [NT-0] chore: Change 'Dirty components map already contains key' log to very verbose by MAG-ThomasGreenhalgh in https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/pull/874
  Changed the log level of the _'Dirty components map already contains key'_ message emitted from `SpaceEntityStatePatcher::SetDirtyComponent` to `VeryVerbose`.

## [6.12.0] - 2025-11-21_18-23-39

### 🍰 🙌 New Features

- [NT-0] feat: Add non-exported iterators to Map by MAG-ElliotMorris in https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/pull/859
  Add non-exported iterators in support of the SWIG generated interop API work.

### 🐛 🔨 Bug Fixes

- [OB-4761] fix: unreal crashes on oko asset drag and drop without internet connection by MAG-ChristopherAtkinson in https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/pull/860
  Ensures the correct return path when attempting to create an entity in OnlineRealtimeEngine.

### 🙈 🙉 🙊 Test Changes

- [NT-0] test: Update QuotaSystem test by MAG-AdamThorn in https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/pull/862
  Updated the QuotaSystem `GetTierFeaturesQuota` test to account for the addition of the new `GoogleGenAI` Quota tier feature in MCS.

## [6.11.0] - 2025-11-18_11-14-15

### 🍰 🙌 New Features

- [OF-1807] feat: support text asset type to support ai chatbot by MAG-ChristopherAtkinson in https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/pull/853
  Introduce a new TEXT EAssetType to support storage of prompt and guardrail assets for the AI chatbot component.
- [OF-1784] feat: Multiplayer System by MAG-mv in https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/pull/842
  Part 1 of the server-side leader election work. Addition of a new Multiplayer System which exposes the necessary functionality for leader election from the mcs MultiplayerServices api.

### 🐛 🔨 Bug Fixes

- [NT-0] fix: List::Insert erasing 0th element by MAG-ElliotMorris in https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/pull/857
  Inserting elements into a List was always adding them as the 0th index rather than at the position specified.
- [OB-4723] fix: exceptions in continuations return incorrect result by MAG-ChristopherAtkinson in https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/pull/846
  In the continuation flow, we would return an invalid result and therefore lose the associated result data. This change ensures the result data from the exception is preserved.
- [NT-0] fix: Use const string ref for return type by MAG-AlessioRegalbuto in https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/pull/856
  As part of ongoing Unity interop API work, we updated the 'MimeTypeHelper' to return a const ref string for the mime type to ensure correct SWIG code generation.
- [OF-1524] fix: Wasm callbacks are now automatically forwarded to the main thread by MAG-mv in https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/pull/806
  This fixes crashes with the log callback if UserSystem::Login fails, and also the MultiplayerConnection::ConnectionInterrupted callback on wasm builds.
- [OB-4961] fix: Some spaces could not find the default scope. by MAG-mv in https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/pull/886
  Fixes issue with EnterSpace with older spaces using an unexpected format for the scope name.
### 🔨 🔨 Chore

- [NT-0] chore: Finish NO_EXPORT heirarchy by MAG-ElliotMorris in https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/pull/848
  Adds NO_EXPORT blocks to symbols that derive from, or are dependent on, base constructs that also have NO_EXPORT. Done in service of the Unity Interop API SWIG initiative.

## Historical releases

In November 2025 we migrated to continuous nightly deployments. Please see the [releases](https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/releases) section of the `connected-spaces-platform` repo for changelogs associated with earlier releases.
