## An interoperable communication library for the spatial internet


⚡️ Current Supported Languages : C++, C#, WebAssembly

🖥️ Current Supported Platforms : Windows, Android, iOS, VisionOS and MacOS

Interoperability is the foundation of the spatial internet. We need experiences to work across multiple technologies in harmony, bridging applications and devices so that we can move beyond a series of disconnected islands.

The Connected Spaces Platform provides developers across a range of languages and platforms with a means to build _interoperable, cross-reality, multi-user applications_.

It comes in the form of an open-source client-side library, effectively encoding (in binary form) the standards by which applications can interoperably communicate with one another. Standards that we can all contribute to.

## 📖 Learn

The official documentation for CSP can be found [here](https://connected-spaces-platform.net/index.html).

* The [Learn](https://connected-spaces-platform.net/learn/learn.html) section includes a range of modules that explain topics ranging from the basic tenets of CSP through to more advanced usage.

* The [Manual](https://connected-spaces-platform.net/manual/manual.html) covers quick start guides, tutorials, plus how to build and debug CSP locally.

* The [API Documentation](https://connected-spaces-platform.net/api/library_root.html) covers the API itself (this documentation can also be found inline in the CSP public API source).
