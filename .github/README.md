## An interoperable communication library for the spatial internet

⚡️ Current Supported Languages : C++, C#, WebAssembly

🖥️ Current Supported Platforms : Windows, Android, iOS, VisionOS and MacOS

📜 See the [Changelog](https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/blob/main/.github/CHANGELOG.md) for details of notable changes for each release.

💾 In November 2025 we migrated to continuous nightly deployments. Please see the [releases](https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/releases) section of the `connected-spaces-platform` repo for changelogs associated with earlier releases.

Interoperability is the foundation of the spatial internet. We need experiences to work across multiple technologies in harmony, bridging applications and devices so that we can move beyond a series of disconnected islands.

The Connected Spaces Platform provides developers across a range of languages and platforms with a means to build _interoperable, cross-reality, multi-user applications_.

It comes in the form of an open-source client-side library, effectively encoding (in binary form) the standards by which applications can interoperably communicate with one another. Standards that we can all contribute to.
