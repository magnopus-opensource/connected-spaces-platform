## Background

Interoperability is the foundation of the spatial internet. We need experiences to work across multiple technologies in harmony, bridging applications and devices so that we can move beyond a series of disconnected islands.

</p>

The Connected Spaces Platform provides developers across a range of languages and platforms with a means to build _interoperable, cross-reality, multi-user applications_.

It comes in the form of an open-source client-side library, effectively encoding (in binary form) the standards by which applications can interoperably communicate with one another. Standards that we can all contribute to.
