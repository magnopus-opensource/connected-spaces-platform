Please write a short description of what this change does and what problem it solves.
For more information, see our [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) page.

Every PR must include either an update to the [.github/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform/blob/main/.github/CHANGELOG.md) file, or have the `skip changelog` label applied to it - this requirement is enforced by a GitHub Action.

The `skip changelog` label should only be used for purely internal changes that have no external impact on users of the library, such as:

- Internal tooling/CI updates: Changes that exclusively affect the build, testing, or deployment.
- Minor code refactors with no behavior change: Code refactors or cleanup that do not alter the library's public API, performance or external behavior.
- Documentation or comment fixes: Corrections to internal code comments, inline documentation, or non-user-facing documentation.
